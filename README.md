## Description

QuickBite is a responsive, front-end food ordering application designed to simulate a real-world restaurant menu and cart system. I built it as part of my full-stack development journey to strengthen my frontend skills using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It's meant for users who want to quickly browse meals, add items to their cart, and begin a checkout flow. It also serves as a professional portfolio piece to showcase my ability to build dynamic interfaces, integrate with APIs, and use clean, responsive design.

## Contributing

This project was developed independently as part of my training in the SimpliLearn Full Stack MERN program. I used Bootstrap docs, the DummyJSON recipe API, and occasional support tools like ChatGPT to guide problem-solving â€” similar to referencing Stack Overflow or MDN. The layout and features were designed by me to reinforce frontend concepts covered in class with instructor Akash.

This README was generated using [my own README Generator CLI app](https://github.com/SlemJosh/readme-generator), a tool I built in Node.js to streamline Markdown documentation for projects like this one.
