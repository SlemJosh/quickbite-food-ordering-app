# QuickBite - Food Ordering Web App
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

QuickBite is a responsive, front-end food ordering application designed to simulate a real-world restaurant menu and cart system. I built it as part of my full-stack development journey to strengthen my frontend skills using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It's meant for users who want to quickly browse meals, add items to their cart, and begin a checkout flow. It also serves as a professional portfolio piece to showcase my ability to build dynamic interfaces, integrate with APIs, and use clean, responsive design.

## Contributing

This project was developed independently as part of my full-stack training. I used Bootstrap documentation and the DummyJSON recipe API for sample data. Some initial structural guidance and files were adapted from instructor Akash’s materials in the SimpliLearn Full Stack MERN program. Special thanks also to my AI assistant “Marty” for helping plan, structure, and refine the code and documentation.

This README was generated using [my own README Generator CLI app](https://github.com/SlemJosh/readme-generator), a tool I built in Node.js to streamline Markdown documentation for projects like this one.
